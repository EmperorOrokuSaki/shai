# Shai

**Shai** is a personal project dedicated to exploring cryptographic primitives through hands-on implementation. It is driven by a desire to deeply understand the foundational principles of modern cryptography and to experiment with diverse approaches, including unconventional techniques like writing assembly code. This repository reflects a learning journey and a space to push the boundaries of cryptographic design :)

## Why "Shai"?
The name "Shai" pays homage to both the elegance and precision of cryptography and the formidable, awe-inspiring Shai-Hulud, the great sandworms from *Dune*. This project captures the vastness and intricacy of these themes, embodying the spirit of curiosity and discovery that drives this work.

## About the Project
**Shai** serves as a sandbox for building cryptographic primitives from scratch. It is not intended for production use, as the code has not been audited or rigorously tested for security. Instead, it acts as a learning tool and a platform for experimentation.

### Key Features
- **Implementation of Core Primitives**: Hash functions, block ciphers, digital signature schemes, and more.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Exploration of methods like low-level assembly code to enhance performance.
- **In-Depth Understanding**: A focus on grasping the inner workings and rationale behind cryptographic algorithms.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
This repository includes:
- **Cryptographic Primitives**: Algorithms implemented from scratch, with detailed notes and explanations.
- **Experimental Ideas**: Innovative approaches to standard implementations, examining performance and design trade-offs.
- **Low-Level Optimizations**: Examples of using assembly and other techniques to achieve greater efficiency.

## Goals
1. **Learn by Doing**: Gain a deeper understanding of cryptographic concepts through direct implementation.
2. **Experiment Freely**: Explore unconventional ideas and methods to approach cryptography from new perspectives.
3. **Optimize and Innovate**: Investigate performance improvements and experiment with non-standard solutions to common challenges.
